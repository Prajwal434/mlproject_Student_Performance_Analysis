Student Performance Analysis
📚 Overview
Student Performance Analysis is a machine learning project aimed at predicting students' academic performance based on various attributes. By analyzing factors such as study hours, attendance, and socio-economic background, the model provides insights that can help educators and institutions enhance student outcomes.

🧠 Problem Statement
Educational institutions often seek to understand the factors influencing student performance to implement effective interventions. This project addresses the challenge by developing a predictive model that assesses student performance, enabling proactive measures to support students' academic success.

🎯 Objectives
Data Analysis: Examine and preprocess student data to identify key features affecting performance.

Model Development: Build and train machine learning models to predict student performance.

Evaluation: Assess model accuracy and reliability using appropriate metrics.

Deployment: Develop a user-friendly web application for real-time predictions.
